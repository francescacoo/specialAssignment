Due to the time constrants, I just produced a basic, rough sample code.
I have used the PHP SDK to send a first SMS (https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/php)
I then created a bot on Autopilot from the console (and tested the creation also using the CLI).
I have added the URL to the webhook for the incoming SMS and tested.
Attached the PHP code and a screenshot of the chat.
